* Short-term
** rewrite --backup based on the same method as --deps but directly on $GEMSROOT. no need to reinstall all gems, much faster...

** slackbuild
** --stash <dir> #if given, --backup will not build gems' packages already present in <dir>/

* Long-term
** rewrite in Ruby (that'd only make sense)
